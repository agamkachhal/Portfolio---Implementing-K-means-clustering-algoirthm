# Portfolio---Implementing-K-means-clustering-algorithm
This Portfolio is about the implementation of `K-means clustering algorithm` which is a very popular unsupervised learning algorithm.

This portfolio covers the below observations:

1. Start with `K` randomly placed cluster centroids
2. For each `data point`, assign it to the `closest cluster centroid`
3. `Re-estimate the cluster centroids for each cluster` based on the data points that belong to it
4. If the `centroid estimate` has not changed significantly, terminate the process, otherwise repeat from step 2.
